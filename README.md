# SocialComputing 📱👥

### Welcome 😉
These are just the start of my social computing project, anyway feel free to enjoy!XD

### List
#### 🕐 '일자리' 트위터 분석 & '마스크' 트위터 분석  

→ Using json files extracted from Twitter(2023.03.14.~2023.03.15.), I made simple analyses on the topic of '마스크' and '일자리' and visualized them. 

#### 👥 Centrality를 활용한 레 미제라블 인물 네트워크 분석

→ Made network analyses on the Les Misérables characters using four centrality measures: Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Eigenvector Centrality  
→ Conducted Community Detection for the main characters using two methods: (1) utilizing the greedy_modularity_communities function and (2) employing the Girvan Newman algorithm  

#### 🍿 Movie_Recommendation_System  

→ Based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, I compared user similarities  
→ Built a recommender system for movies(User-User Collaborative Filtering), using Matrix Factorization  
→ Conducted an analysis of the number of latent nodes in Matrix Factorization  

#### 💿 PageRank_analysis  

→ Implemented the PageRank algorithm using both a loop approach and a MapReduce approach, followed by a comparison of their performance

#### 🏡 Spatial Segregation based on Homophily_Shelling Model  

→ Spatial segregation using the Shelling model  
→ Analyzed the changes in spatial segregation patterns when a minority group is introduced  

#### 🍷 wine_classification & wine_clustering

→ Analyzed the optimal number of clusters for dividing red wine using K-means  
→ Built a ML classification model to predict the quality of wine, using structured data on wine characteristics
